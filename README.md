<!-- ## About Onesimos -->
**Onesimos** ('helpful', Latinized *Onesimus*) is a Vim configuration.

It aims to provide a vim-style experience for both the **daily uses** and **academic production**. 

<!-- It is not only usable but aesthetically amusing. -->
<!-- Markdown, TeX, Python. Haskell -->
<!-- Future: Agda -->

General configuration has taken account of [sensible.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) which is probably the highest common factor of many configurations. Other configurations, e.g. keymaps, are following the principle of [*Convention over configuration*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration).

Any concerns related to this repository can be issued.

## Installation

### Goals
- Project
  - [ ] Register Onesimos as a Plugin; Write a doc
  - [ ] Implement something like emacs' **list-packages**. The first time installation will pop up a checklist of what language to support, and puts those in the custom plugin file
  - [ ] Full compatibility with Linux (See [Compatibility Milestone](https://github.com/BaksiLi/Onesimos/milestone/1))

- Functionality
  - [x] Utilize Asynchronous technology in [CompileRun](./functions/CompileRun.vim) and LSP
  - [x] [Word Processing Mode](./functions/WordProcMode.vim) for Markdown and other plain text format
  - Built-in Literate Programming (+ REPL)
    - [x] [OpenREPL](./functions/OpenREPL.vim)
    - [ ] Interactive Kernel
    - [ ] Haskell, Python, Wolfram Language

## Keymaps
The default leader key is `\`.

#### Dotfile
- `<leader>ed` to edit the dotfile while in vim;
- `<leader>sd` to reload dotfile.
- `<leader>h` to view help document.

#### Editing
- `lkj` (insert mode) to change to normal mode.
- `<space>` to fold manually.
- `<C-e>` to expand snippets.

- `<leader>tr` to toggle enable relative numbering.
- `<leader>tp` to toggle rainbow parenthesis.
- `<leader>ti` to toggle indent lines.

- `]a`/`[a` to go to the next/previous lint position.
- `]b`/`[b` to go to the next/previous buffer position.

- `gd` to go to the current function definition.
- `gs`/`gS` to search symbol in the workspace.
- `<leader>rn` to refactor current cursor function.

#### IDE Features
- `<leader>ff` to open fuzzy finder for the current working directory (LeaderF).
- `<leader>fl` to open fuzzy finder for the current file.
- `<leader>fb` to open fuzzy finder for buffers.
- `<leader>ft` to open fuzzy finder for tags.

- `<F2>` to Toggle Tagbar.
- `<F3>` to Toggle File Tree (NERDTree).
- `<F4>` to Open a terminal window REPL for the specific language of the file (Visual Mode will be supported soon).
- `<F5>` to Run or Compile the current file.
  - Preview Markdown, Compile LaTeX, Run Python Script, Load Vim Settings and so on.
- `<F6>` to Format the current file.

## Explained
I have divided the traditional `.vimrc` into several files and folders in order to improve its scalability with more configurations and compatibility with multiple platforms.

<details>
<summary>File Structure</summary>

<!-- by `tree . -L 1` -->
```
.
├── **customs**
├── **snippets**
├── **functions**
├── **plugconf**
├── init.vim
├── README.md
└── automated.vim
```

where there are (currently) three folders of differenciated functions and a few config file named `init.vim` (main) and `automated.vim`.

</details>

### init.vim
   This is the main config file, which was inherited from the old vimrc. As you could read from the above, it is acting as the outline of all other `.vim`s.

### automated.vim
   This is where the system test and install prerequisites to support normal functions of plugins.

### ./custom
  This is where to store custom configurations. `plugins.vim` is the Plugin configuration file.

### ./plugconf
   The configurations of plugins could be found here with their name as the title followed by '.vim'.

### ./functions
   The folder where customised functions are stored.

### ./snippets
   The default folder for storing snippet rules for [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips). The folder under `~/.vim` should be of limited use.

Notice that these folders and files are auto-loaded even for the first time your `.vimrc` is sourced. Adding of any new functionalities will not need manual loading as placing them in their corresponding folder should suffice.
